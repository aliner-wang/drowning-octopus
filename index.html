        <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
        <p>For our final project we learned Three.js and implemented a water scene. We explored how to simulate smoke particles in a physically-realistic 3D setting, fluid dynamics, and WebGL shaders. Ultimately, we decided to create an open, 3D setting
            with camera controls that displayed a shaded 2D plane which mimics a 3D ocean scene. We used Blinn-Phong shading for reflectivity/refractivity and introduced a time variant to emulate wave movements and light scattering. We also included our
            smaller accomplishments such as a smoke-particle torch, blender-generated octopus, and three.js gui in the final scene to demonstrate our progress throughout the entire project.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
        <p>Given that all of us had no experience with Three.js and smoke and fluid simulations, the first few weeks were spent researching and implementing toy solutions. We read papers, played around with several simulations, and watched several tutorials
            on Three.js and smoke/fluid simulations to find the best way to translate physics into a simulation.
        </p>
        <p>From the start, we wanted to simulate water or smoke in an interactive 3D space. We attempted to build off of existing simulations by adding a third dimension. However, we found our approach to be flawed since adding a z-axis alone could not accurately
            represent the physics of fluid or smoke correctly. Introducing another axis required knowledge of the underlying mathematical models, which we were all unfamiliar with and inexperienced in. Smoke was also much harder to represent correctly,
            therefore we attempted to focus more on water. </p>

        <p>
            Because of this, we decided to switch gears to an alternative method – treating water as a 2D plane. We can then rotate the plane horizontally and shade the plane. Instead of focusing on the physical properties of fluids, we decided to model how the water
            should look and shade the 2D plane to emulate a 3D ocean scene. We built our scene following a tutorial on building an ocean using the water object in Three.js’s library. We then built our water object modeled off of Mr.Droob’s three.js library.
        </p>

            <tr align="Middle">

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Water has many interesting visual properties, but we focused mainly on reflectivity/refractivity. In order to emulate the reflective property of water, we used the Blinn-Phong reflectivity model from class. We referenced code used in existing Blinn-Phong
            shaders, one example which can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn–Phong_reflection_model. We also introduce refractivity, which is nearly identical to reflectivity except for the angle and direction of the ray. These alone
            are enough to capture the reflectivity/refractivity properties of water, but applying these methods by themselves would reveal an unconvincing, shiny plane with little variations. Especially since we are projecting our texture map onto the
            2D plane, you would essentially see our texture map, but shiny.
        </p>

        <table width="100%">
            <tr align="Middle">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/blinn-phong.png" width="350px" align="middle" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Blinn-Phong Shading Model</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>



        <p>In order to truly simulate a “moving” ocean, we use a time variable captured from the three.js animator and apply an offset to the pixel’s position on the texture map. This creates an effect of stretching and squashing the texture map, all while
            maintaining the same relative size “pulled” over the 2D plane. As a contrived metaphor, imagine stretching a sheet cover over your mattress. As long as the edges are “tucked,” you can push and pull at the top of the mattress and see the sheet
            cover move around. In our scenario, the mattress is the 2D plane and the sheet cover is our texture map. This time-step hack gives the illusion that the ocean is moving back and forth, like waves would.

        <h2 align="middle">Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, we encountered two major challenges throughout the project. First, all of us did not have experience with Three.js or WebGL so we had a difficult time learning the framework and understanding how the rendering process worked with the inclusion
            of shaders. Moreover, we struggled to learn how to build custom shaders in three.js and integrate it as a similar strategy to how other projects implemented their particle system model. Secondly, we struggled to settle on a goal. We started
            off wanting to render black holes, then pivoted to smoke simulations, and finally to focus on water. That put us under a huge time crunch and made it harder for us to understand what was necessary to render something accurately in 3D space.
